<p>Many composers throughout music history have tried to capture this feeling of dreaming in their music. Whether is a day-dreaming kind of state, also called r√™verie, or a night-dreaming the point is to create melodies that capture perfectly this lost-in-thought, meditative mood.</p>

<p>Based on a poem by French poet Victor Hugo, this is a remarkable piece in every possible way. The writing is intricate and expressive, the musical ideas are original and encompass a wide range of emotions.</p>

<p>The main challenge here is to play the accompaniment parts. The rhythm and direction of the notes are intentionally inconsistent, and the eighth notes move freely around the harmony as if it was floating in the air, like in a dream.</p>

Are you prone to road rage at times? The German government is worried about the high number of road accidents on the country‚Äôs motorways (2.4 million annually). Many of these accidents are caused by aggressive driving and road rage. 

To counteract this, the German Ministry of Transport has released a CD for drivers which features Mozart‚Äôs Piano Concerto No.21. played by the Minister himself! He hopes that the soothing effects of music will calm drivers down. 

(Fun fact: There is no word in German for road rage).

Fans have flocked to a church in Germany to hear a chord change in a musical composition that lasts for 639 years. Yes, it‚Äôs not a typo. The work is by the avant-garde American composer, John Cage called As Slow As Possible. It began 19 years ago and changed chord for first time in seven years. The score is made up of eight pages of music, to be played at the piano or organ - very slowly. So slowly that the piece will end in 2640.
