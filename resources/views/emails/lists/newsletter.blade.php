We’re living through a once-in-a-generation event, and like you, we’ve been finding it difficult to make sense of it all. The coronavirus has obliterated many things about normal life, we are spending a whole lot of time at home and have no excuses about not practicing!

It's clear we are going to be living like this for a while, so we might as well get the best out of it.

<p>We've recently added this wonderful piece into our app’s “Playlists” tab, under the Hidden Gems category. We literally fell in love with it. It’s probably because of the nostalgia it evokes. It sounds like a music box playing an old charming tune.</p>

<p>The composer Anatoly Lyadov was a Russian musician whose orchestral works and poetic polished piano miniatures earned him a position of stature in Russian Romantic music.</p>

Ever wondered how Tchaikovsky voice might have sounded like? Well, there’s a recording for that!

The following recording of was made in Moscow in January 1890, by Julius Block on behalf of Thomas Edison. According to musicologist Leonid Sabaneyev, Tchaikovsky was not comfortable with being recorded for posterity and tried to shy away from it. Here below a transcription of what you’ll hearing this recording.

Listen to the recording <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DEEdFLjUiw&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">here</a>!

Here's a transcription of the conversation:

- Anton Rubinstein: What a wonderful thing.
- J. Block: Certainly.
- E. Lavrovskaya A disgusting...how he dares slyly to name me.
- Vasily Safonov: (Sings).
- P. Tchaikovsky: This trill could be better.
- E. Lavrovskaya: (sings).
- P. Tchaikovsky: Block is a good fellow, but Edison is even better.
- E. Lavrovskaya: (sings) A-o, a-o.
- V. Safonov: (In German) Peter Jurgenson in Moscow.
- P. Tchaikovsky: Who just spoke? It seems to have been Safonov. (Whistles)

We’re reading a very interesting book called “The ballad of blind Tom”. In this book, the author describes the life if Blind Tom Wiggins, a blind african-american composer with an astonishing musical gift, born into slavery in the US of the late 19th century. 

We’ll be making a blog post of the book once finished, so stay tuned if you’re curios to know more about blind Tom and his incredible music! 

Find the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ballad-Blind-Tom-Slave-Pianist-ebook/dp/B07RW44KW9/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=blind+tom&qid=1589513880&sr=8-2" target="_blank">here</a>.
