<p>Maria Teresa Agnesi was an accomplished Italian composer. Not much survived of what she did for keyboard, but this sonata is testimony to her great talent and capabilities. Does it sound just like something CPE Bach would have written? The early decades of the Classical period were marked by vibrant, bold, and optimistic music. The writing was simple and the texture clean, providing incredible contrast to the music of the Baroque period.</p>

<p>This beautiful short sonata embodies the spirit of this generation and it will help you develop clean and even playing on the left hand, as well as nuanced scale passages on the right hand.</p>

Leon Fleisher, the legendary pianist, died at age 92 in Baltimore. He was not only an incredible musician, but an example of resilience and perseverance. Unable to use his right hand, he performed pieces written for left hand only, conducted and taught. Years later, he made a triumphant two-handed comeback.
