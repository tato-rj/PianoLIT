<p>We would like to use this month‚Äôs introduction to give a shoutout to <strong>A Seat at the Piano</strong> and the incredible work they are doing with their project.</p>

<p>ASAP was founded in the summer of 2020 in the midst of social and racial reckoning around the world. Their mission is to promote and advocate for the inclusion, study, and performance of a more equitably representative body of piano works. With their website platform, they strive to raise the voices of those who are less heard and to inspire more thoughtful, inclusive programming within the performing and pedagogical spheres.</p>

<p>Check their website <a href="https://www.aseatatthepiano.com/" target="_blank">here</a> üëèüëèüëè</p>

<p>Max Reger was a German composer and teacher, active during the last years of the ‚Äò800 and the first decades of the ‚Äò900 and famous for his organ works. His opus 17 is a collection of 20 short pieces that brings back fond memories from the composer's youth, much like Schumann's Opus 15 "Scenes from Childhood". These are not easy pieces for beginners but rather inspired by the composer's memories.</p>

<p>One piece in particular, is a rendition of the famous and beloved Silent Night. Here the right hand resembles the delicate sound of tiny bells accompanying the main theme. The coordination between the distinct rhythmic groups in the right hand and the melody in the left hand is the main challenge.</p>

<p>The early decades of the Classical period were marked by vibrant, bold, and uplifting music. The writing was simple and the texture clean, providing incredible contrast to the music of the Baroque period that had just ended.</p>

<p>This beautiful short sonata embodies the spirit of this generation and it will help you develop clean and even playing on the left hand, as well as nuanced scale passages on the right hand.</p>
