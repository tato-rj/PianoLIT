<p>This piece is from a Suite of 6 pieces that tell the famous story of Sleeping Beauty. These are programmatic pieces that depict incredibly well the mood and character of each scene. They are also very pianistic and a great choice to supplement the repertoire of intermediate level pianists.</p>

<p>It was written by Berenice Benson Bentley, an extremely talented composer, who wrote  beautiful melodies and captivating music, but very little is known about her life. What we do know is that the name, Berenice Benson Bentley, was a pen name.</p>

The Hurrian Hymn is History's first Song. Actually the earliest written song that can be reconstructed. We're not even sure what the song even sounds like, but each attempt to decode has its own value. All we are sure about is that the Hurrian Hymn is really, really ancient and nothing is as clear as it seems. Watch this video to learn more.
