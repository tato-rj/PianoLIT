<p>We all know the exotic Argentinian dance of tango which evolved from the lower-class districts of Buenos Aires to reach fame in fashionable European circles during the 1915. The early tangos were spirited and lively, but later the music and lyrics became intensely melancholy. the word "tango" was often applied to dances in a 2/4 or 4/4 rhythm such as the one-step.</p>

<p>This interesting piece by Timothy Brown takes the exhuberance and pop knowledge of th efamous dance and translates it into a great piece ofr mid intermediate pianists. One of the main challanges in this piece is to interpret correctly the piece's character by understanding what a tango should sound like. Marrying this idea with a lean and clear sound on left hand octaves.</p>

<p> If composers like Chopin were alive today they would certainly be making a lot of money, but that was not always the case in their lifetime. Chopin's letters give us a sneak peek into his finances and how much he actually made. </p>
