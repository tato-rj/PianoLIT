<p>‚ÄúHistories‚Äù is a collection of 10 impressionistic short pieces for intermediate levels, an excellent choice for those starting to learn this genre.</p>

<p>The Leader of the Golden Turtles (La meneuse de tortues d'or) has a stately and noble character with broad sounds and gestures. The first theme is lighter with and almost improvisatory character, while the second theme is much more serious and confident. Both themes return at the end mixed together, and the challenge here is in playing them at the same time while maintaining their original character and articulation.</p>
