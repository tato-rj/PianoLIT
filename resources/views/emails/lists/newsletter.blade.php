<p>When thinking about a piece to feature during the Halloween month, nothing better than Alkan‚Äôs ‚ÄúSong of the Madwoman by the Seashore‚Äù. A brilliant piece with a dark and sinister atmosphere. So evocative that it will get you chills down your spine while playing! While most of Alkan‚Äôs compositions are advanced music, this piece which is part of his Preludes Op. 31 is more around the late intermediate level.</p>

<p>Charles Valentine Alkan was a pianist active during the Parisian years that saw Chopin and Liszt a the heart of the musical scene. Alkan was there among them. Extremely talented and a virtuoso, his music is very demanding technically. When he turned 35, Alkan began to adopt a reclusive life style, while continuing with his compositions.</p>

<p>If you've played piano before, you‚Äôre probably familiar with the concept of sight-reading. Sight-reading is the practice of reading and performing a piece that you've never seen before. The benefits of skillful sight-reading are many, but don‚Äôt fall in the mistake of thinking that sight-readers are born that way. The art of sight-reading can, and should, be taught.</p>

<h1 class="text-lg mb-4">COOL FACTS TO SHARE THIS MONTH:</h1>

@component('mail::panel')
On the occasion of Beethoven's 250th birthday, the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna serves up a very special exhibition called ‚Äú‚ÄùBeethoven moves. It combines paintings, sketchbooks, graphics, sculptures, and videos with music and Beethoven the person. 

The exhibition is to be seen as a poetic reflection of his creative work. Beethoven's masterpieces enter into a connection with the masterpieces of the visual arts (painting, sculpture, graphics, drawings, photography, and video) and thus create a new total work of art of Beethoven. 

The visitor is invited to locate their own body in the space and thus to put it in relationship to the music, language, image, and movement. A whole-body experience that leads to a very special encounter with the great composer.
