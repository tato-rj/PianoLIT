          Start your 7-day free trial by signing up for a Blinkist yearly plan. You are under no obligation to stay for the whole year and will not be charged until the 7-day free trial is over—just subscribe, learn to your heart’s content, and cancel any time before your 7 free days have passed. Please note that you may only start a trial once. If you have previously purchased a Blinkist subscription, you will not be able to start a new trial.
