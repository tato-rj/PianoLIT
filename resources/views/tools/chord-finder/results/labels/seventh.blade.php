			We also refer to a diminished chord that has a diminished 7th (a normal minor 7th lowered one step further down) as a <strong>fully diminished chord</strong>, which is the case here.

			We also refer to a diminished chord that has a minor 7th as a <strong>half diminished chord</strong>, which is the case here.
			@else
			The number 7 alone next to the chord usually implies a minor 7th, if it is major you'll see M7, or +7, or even maj7.
