	<p>The Key Signature is where the composer will indicate which notes (if any) are sharps or flats. That indication follows a specific order and it tells you what is the <strong>key</strong> the piece. You can find the Key Signature located at the beginning of the score, right after the clefs.</p>

	<p>For every major key, there is one other minor key that <strong>shares the exact same notes</strong> and vice-versa: each major key has a <i>relative minor</i> and each minor key has a <i>relative major</i>. For that reason they both share the same <i>key signature</i>, having the exact same sharp notes or flats notes in it.</p>
