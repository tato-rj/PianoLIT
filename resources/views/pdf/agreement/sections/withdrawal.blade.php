	<p class="bold">WITHDRAWAL FROM LESSONS</p>
	<p>If you need to withdraw from lessons, I appreciate as much notice as possible. To withdraw during the
	school year (September-May), I charge a $50 fee in addition to the remainder of the current month’s
	tuition. This is to partially cover the time I have reserved for you.</p>

	<p class="bold">DISCONTINUATION</p>
	<p>In an extreme situation, I reserve the right to discontinue lessons with a student at any time. Disrespect,
	continual lateness or absenteeism, or an ongoing breach of any studio policy may result in discontinuation. In
	this case, I will prorate the current month’s tuition and refund any portion that has not been used. The
	registration fee is not refunded.</p>
