	<p class="bold">TUITION & FEES</p>
	<ul>
		<li>30-minute lessons: $180/month</li>
		<li>45-minute lessons: $210/month</li>
		<li>60-minute lessons: $230/month</li>
		<li>Annual Registration Fee: $35</li>
	</ul>

	<p>From September to May, tuition is always a monthly rate. I do not consider it a “per lesson” rate as it also
	includes studio classes and the recital.</p>

	<p class="bold">PAYMENT</p>
	<p>Invoices are sent by email in the middle of each month and payment is due by the first of the month. You
	can pay online or bring cash or check to the lesson. You may also save a credit card for automatic
	payments.</p>
