	<p class="bold">SCHEDULING</p>
	<p>From {{getMonthName($data['start_month'])}} through {{getMonthName($data['end_month'])}}, lessons are weekly and follow the set Studio Calendar (included with this
		packet). For scheduling purposes, I divide this time into two “semesters,” before and after winter break.
		Once you register for a lesson time, it is set for the semester. If you wish to change your lesson time due to
		a changing sports schedule or other activity, winter break is the best time to look ahead and make the
		change. If you are having difficulty with your lesson time, it may be possible to switch with another student,
	but that is not guaranteed.</p>

	<p>Students are provided with a Studio Calendar that lists all lessons, breaks, special events, and make-up days.
		School district calendars in our area sometimes differ, so please refer specifically to the Studio Calendar to
	know when lessons are scheduled.</p>

	<p class="bold">SUMMER SCHEDULE & TUITION</p>
	<p>From {{getMonthName($data['end_month'] + 1)}} through {{getMonthName($data['start_month'] - 1)}}, lessons are on a flexible sign-up basis. Students sign up online for individual
		lessons, and can choose from a variety of times that accommodate ever-changing camp and travel
		schedules. Many students use this opportunity to try out longer or more frequent lessons to dig into a more
	ambitious project. (Did you beg to learn Hamilton or Harry Potter all year? Summer is the perfect time!)</p>

	<p><u>Summer Tuition</u></p>
	<p>Because of the flexible nature of summer lessons, we switch to a “per-lesson” rate, payable when you sign
		up. Due to some changes in the way I’m scheduling summer in 2018, the summer lesson rate is currently
	TBD.</p>
