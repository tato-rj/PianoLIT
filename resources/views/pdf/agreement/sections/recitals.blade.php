	<p class="bold">STUDIO CLASSES & RECITALS</p>
	<p>Three times per year, students gather for an informal, 75-minute studio class. This is a chance to play for
	each other in a supportive environment, to get comfortable with the energy of performing, and to build our 
	community of pianists. Studio class also includes enrichment activities such as sight-reading, ear-training, and
	rhythm games. Studio classes are students-only!
	Recitals are festive events that celebrate the students’ most polished work with friends and family. This year,
	our final spring recital will be Saturday, May 19, 11:00 in the beautiful Ensemble Room at Mills College.</p>

	<p class="bold">EXTRA PERFORMANCE OPPORTUNITIES</p>
	<p>I encourage students to take whatever performance opportunities appeal to them, from talent shows, to
	family gatherings, to formal auditions and evaluations. I support this by staying knowledgeable about
	recommended repertoire, registration, guidelines, and deadlines. Below are some examples:</p>

	<p><u>Certificate of Merit</u> is a schedule of evaluations offered through Music Teachers’ Association of California
	(MTAC). Students learn pieces from a list of recommended repertoire, and perform 2-3 polished pieces for
	a panel of teachers for written feedback.</p>

	<p><u>MTAC Recitals</u> — in addition to our final studio recital, students may register for extra recitals in our
	community. Work must be highly polished for these events.</p>

	<p><u>ABRSM Practical Exams</u> — The Associated Board of the Royal School of Music is an internationally known
	curriculum and system of evaluations. Students play “exams” of assigned repertoire and scales for a panel of
	teachers, then receive grades and written feedback. Because ABRSM is quite rigorous and well known,
	students passing Grade 5 and higher are well-prepared to take college auditions.</p>

	<p><u>ABRSM Theory Exams</u> — Theory whizzes may want to skip the practical exam and challenge themselves by
	taking written theory exams. Students who follow this course become well positioned to breeze through
	AP Music Theory in high school.</p>

	<p>These organizations charge registration fees that are not covered in your lesson tuition.</p>
