	<p class="bold">INSTRUMENT</p>
	<p>The best choice, if possible, is an acoustic piano. When playing an acoustic piano, the vibration from the
		hammer striking the string travels through the fingers, creating much more nuanced technique in the
		musician. A digital piano is slightly inferior in this way. It is a useful tool for imitating the sound of a piano, but
		the physical responsiveness is somewhat lost. Space and cost are more comparable between the two
		instruments than many people assume. Sound level is of course another practical consideration. If you are
		unsure, I am happy to discuss this in person. I have helped many families choose an instrument that is just
	right for their circumstances.</p>

	<p><u>Requirements for a digital piano:</u></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Full range (88 keys)</li>
		<li>Fully weighted keys (keys have a bit of tension to mimic the heavier keys of a piano)</li>
		<li>Equipped with music stand and pedal</li>
		<li>Set on a sturdy stand or table at proper height (about 28” from floor)</li>
		<li>Bench at a height that keeps forearms level while playing - use folded towels or a firm cushion to
		increase bench height</li>
	</ul>
	<p>A digital piano that doesn’t meet these requirements doesn’t work for piano lessons.</p>
