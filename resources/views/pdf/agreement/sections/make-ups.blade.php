	<p class="bold">ABSENCE & MAKE-UP POLICY</p>
	<p>Please take special note of this policy in order to avoid any misunderstanding.</p>
	<p class="text-center"><u>MISSED LESSONS ARE <strong>NOT</strong> REFUNDED</u></p>

	<p>No-show or cancellation with less than {{$data['absence_notice']}} hoursâ€™ notice: You have forfeited the lesson and it will not be
	made up.</p>
	<p>Advance reschedule or cancellation: I provide one Student Make-Up Day per semester (see Studio
		Calendar). I can sometimes facilitate a conversation between students to switch times with each other, but
	this is at my discretion and not guaranteed.</p>

	<p><u>Teacher cancellation</u>: In the event that I must cancel, I will offer 3 options for an additional make-up day.
	Students who do not sign up for a make-up lesson will not be offered additional options.</p>

	<p><u>Sickness</u>: Do not come to your lesson sick. Many hands share the piano each day. If a student displays
	obvious signs of a contagious illness, I will contact the grown-up for an early pick-up.</p>

	<p><u>Summer Absence Policy</u></p>
	<p>Even though sign-up is flexible during the summer, the absence policy is not. Please choose carefully! When
		you sign up for a lesson, it is reserved for you and is not shown as an available time for other interested
	students. For that reason, I do not reschedule and/or refund missed lessons, even in summer.</p>

	<p><u>Teaching Artist Commitment</u></p>
	<p>I balance my teaching schedule with an active freelancing career. Your
		scheduled lessons are yours, and I do not accept conflicting gigs or rehearsals. However, for very
		extraordinary opportunities such as a tour or residency, I reserve the right to temporarily change my
		teaching schedule. In this case, I work with students individually to come up with the best option for that
		period of time, which may include prorated tuition, additional make-ups, or arranging for a sub. This is very
		rare. I always do my best to ensure that these two branches of my work dovetail with each other and
	inform one another.</p>
